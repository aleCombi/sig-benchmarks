# benchmark_sweep.yaml
# Defines the parameter sweep for benchmarking

# Path configuration
path_kind: "sin"  # "linear" or "sin"

# N scaling (row 1): path lengths
# Tests how performance scales with sequence length
Ns: [200, 500, 1000]

# d scaling (row 2): path dimensions
# Tests how performance scales with ambient dimension
Ds: [2, 5, 10]

# m scaling (row 3): signature truncation levels
# Tests how performance scales with signature depth
# Note: signature dimension grows as O(d^m)
Ms: [2, 3, 4]

# Operations to benchmark
operations:
  - signature
  - logsignature

# Number of repeats for each configuration
# Higher values give better statistical stability
repeats: 10

# Method for logsignature computation in iisignature
logsig_method: "S"

# Output directory for benchmark runs
runs_dir: "runs"
